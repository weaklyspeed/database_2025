1NF (First Normal Form) → No repeating groups, atomic values only.
2NF (Second Normal Form) → Must already be in 1NF, and no partial dependency (every non-key attribute depends on the whole primary key, not part of it).
3NF (Third Normal Form) → Must already be in 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependency (non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes).
